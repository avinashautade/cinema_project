        RRR[a] (subtitled onscreen as Roudram Ranam Rudhiram) is a 2022 Indian
        Telugu-language epic period action drama film directed by S. S.
        Rajamouli, who co-wrote the film with V. Vijayendra Prasad. It was
        produced by D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainment. The film stars N. T.
        Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Shriya Saran,
        Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody, and Olivia Morris. It
        revolves around the fictional versions of two Indian revolutionaries,
        Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Rama Rao), their
        friendship, and their fight against the British Raj. Rajamouli came
        across stories about the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem and connected the
        coincidences between them, imagining what would have happened had they
        met, and been friends. The film was announced in March 2018. Principal
        photography of the film began in November 2018 in Hyderabad and
        continued until August 2021, owing to delays caused by the COVID-19
        pandemic. It was filmed extensively across India, with a few sequences
        filmed in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's soundtrack and background
        score were composed by M. M. Keeravani, with cinematography by K. K.
        Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril is the film's
        production designer whilst V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual
        effects.
